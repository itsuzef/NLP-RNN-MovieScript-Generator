# NLP-RNN-MovieScript-Generator

The task is character generation, to evenutally create a full script. 
Using the NLP model to generate the next character in a sequence of text. 
We are going to use it over and over again to generate an entire script. 
#Word Embeddings: a layer that we will add to our model
#LTSM longterm-shortterm memory

Attached is a movie script dataset where you can train the model on 1 movie, or all movies!
